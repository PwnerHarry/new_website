# Reasoning and Learning Lab Website Redesign

This repo contains the **alpha build** of the new website redesign. The existing website is hard to maintain as its a plain old html file. The proposed redesign should make website maintenance easy and can be done by anyone in the lab, directly from Github.

- Easy to maintain, as it uses Jekyll to generate webpages
- Easy to contribute, as you can just write markdown files
- Easy to update personal information, which can be made by just editing the `.yml` files
- Easy to deploy, as any PR merge will trigger remote build and push to our server (not available now, proposed)

The website is powered by [al-folio]() Jekyll theme, which is now increasingly used by many personal portfolios, labs and conferences.
