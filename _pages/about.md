The research in the Reasoning and Learning Lab, co-directed by Professors [Prakash Panangaden](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash), [Doina Precup](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup), [Joelle Pineau](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau), [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung), [Siva Reddy](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/siva-reddy/), [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/reihaneh-rabbany/), [Siamak Ravanbakhsh] (https://cs.mcgill.ca/~siamak/) and [David Rolnick](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/david-rolnick/) is broadly concerned with the study of probabilistic systems. Current areas of interest include Markov processes, deep learning and its applications, reinforcement learning, natural language processing and computational linguistics. The lab is a core member of the [Quebec AI Institute (Mila)](https://mila.quebec).

Our research is funded by generous grants from [NSERC](http://www.nserc.ca/), [FQRNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/), and both the [Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies](http://www.mcgill.ca/gps) and the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) of [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/).
